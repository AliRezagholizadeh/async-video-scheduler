# async-video-scheduler

Did you think of launching a timely video player which is streaming a source of videos at specified times?

This event-based tool aim at timely streaming from an ordered-video source. In the case of disconnection, the frames would be streamed
from the point when there wasn't any interruption.

### Step-by-Step: Setup MediaMTX as a Local RTMP Server
#### Step 1: Download and Install MediaMTX
Go to: üëâ https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases

Download the appropriate binary for your OS:

- Windows: mediamtx.exe

- macOS/Linux: mediamtx

Unzip and place the binary in a known folder.
```
mediamtx/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mediamtx         # binary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mediamtx.yml     # config file
```

#### Step 2: Default Configuration (No Change Needed)
MediaMTX uses mediamtx.yml as its config file, but the default config needs to be adjusted to enable RTMP at rtmp://localhost:1935/live/stream.

Adjust `paths` section of the config file to:
```
paths:
  all:
    source: publisher # accept streams from FFmpeg or OBS
```

#### Step 3: Run MediaMTX
In your terminal:
```bash
./mediamtx
```
You should see:
```nginx
INF RTMP listener opened on :1935
```
MediaMTX is now acting as a local RTMP server.



### Stream to MediaMTX from FFmpeg
Base ffmpeg command used to pass the right video to the RTMP server:
```commandline
ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/live/stream
```
which `input` could be a dynamic pipeline (e.g., using overlays or named pipes).




### Configuring OBS to Watch the Stream
1- Open OBS

2- Add a new Media Source

3- Uncheck Local File

4- Set the URL to:
`rtmp://localhost:1935/live/stream`


5- (Optional) Set Buffering to 0 for lowest latency

OBS will now display your FFmpeg stream in real time.
